# Introduction

This is a simple application for managing users. The backend code is in the server directory, the frontend code in the
client directory.

# Tasks:

Not intended for all to be done. Pick the ones that seems interesting

- Display users in a nicer way (frontend) // done
- Display details for a user in a nicer way (frontend) //done
- The search bar does nothing. Can we make it either:
  - search for a user in the server (fullstack) // done
  - filter the list for a match (frontend) // done
- Only the first 5 users are displayed. Can we make it so that we can see all 300 users? (frontend) // done
- Can we make it possible to add a new user (fullstack) // done
- Can we make it possible to remove user? (fullstack) // done
- Can we make the client update when a user has been added externally? (fullstack) // done
